## Task / feature management

Our tasks are all managed on a Github Project. There are four columns for each task

- _backlong_ - the entry point for new issues
- _to do_ - any card on here are ready to be worked on and can be picked up by any dev
- _in progress_ - assign yourself to a card / task / issue and move it to this "doing" column so everyone knows it's in progress
- _Code review_ - if your issue is ready for lead devs to review then create a PR and move it to this column
- _Done_ - once your issue is done, a dev lead can move it here, it's now ready to ship :rocket:

## Branching strategy

### main branch

The ONLY branch that should be merged to is the `main` (once all tests have passed). This branch is what will be deployed to production. If you spot a bug in production sing out to a dev lead. They'll sort you out. We've protected this branch so in theory only the dev leads can push / merge to it.

### feature branches

When starting on a new feature you need to branch off of the `main` branch

Features should be named something like `feature/123-adding-songs`. The first half (feature) let's folks know what kind of branch this is. A feature branch is in development and is not ready for deployment yet. The second half is a descriptive name of the feature you are building.

### hotfix

A hotfix branch will happen if a bug is spotted in production. Only dev leads should create a hotfix branch. See them for more info. They follow the same naming convention as feature branches, something like `hotfix/usersCantLogIn`

### Unit/Integration tests

To test an individual test, use **npx**:

```
npx vitest events.test.js
```

To run all tests:

```
npm run test
```

To run one single test, add `.only` after `it`

```
it.only('my test name goes here', () => {
  // here test goes here
))

```

Then you can run the test file individually, `npm test events.test.js`.
